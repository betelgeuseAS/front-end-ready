In the `src/components` folder, you'll find many different projects divided into categories. Select a category and find the `index.html` file and open it in your browser to see a live demo. Also, each component contains a `README.md` file that gives a description of the component and a demo in the form of a media file.

In the `src/libraries` folder, you'll find many different third-party libraries that are used in some components.
